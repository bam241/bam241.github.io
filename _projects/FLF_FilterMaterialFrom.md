recommendation_text: "I've worked with Baptiste on open source software projects including DAGMC and OpenMC. I also benefited from being able to contract Baptiste for specific additions to OpenMC which has been very useful. During the contracts he has keep me informed of progress delivered, been attentive to the specific request and delivered as expected. It was very convenient hiring Baptiste through GitHub sponsors which allows for flexible hourly rates. This has been great as it allows us to adapt the task while carrying out the work if new aspects of the task are discovered. I much prefer this to a traditional contract where fixed deliverables are established ahead of time with little knowledge of the project."
