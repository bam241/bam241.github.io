title: "Uranium traceability"
description: "I conducted a parametric study using the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator to analyze the propagation of a hypothetical uranium isotope tracker within the US civilian nuclear fuel cycle. This tracker, introduced into the uranium stream just before the enrichment process, served as a proxy for monitoring and verifying nuclear material flow. The study focused on understanding the speed at which this tracker would propagate through the different stages of the fuel cycle, from enrichment, fuel fabrication, and reactor operation, to spent fuel storage and potential reprocessing. A key aspect of the study involved examining the prioritization of existing uranium stockpiles and how this impacts the tracker's progression. By modeling different stockpile management strategies and consumption rates, I assessed their influence on the observed distribution and concentration of the tracker over time. This analysis provided valuable insights into the dynamics of material flow within the fuel cycle and the effectiveness of using such a tracker for nuclear material accountancy and control."
