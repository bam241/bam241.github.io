title: "Scientific Computing Software Development Support"
description: "I supported NAAREA's advanced nuclear reactor development through a best practices mission focused on improving their computational  modeling and simulation workflows. My work involved comprehensive code review, optimization of nuclear physics simulation tools, and implementation of robust software engineering practices. I advised the team on implementing a standardized Docker-based calculation environment, guiding the development of a reproducible and portable computational workflow that ensures consistent simulation setups across different computing platforms. This containerized approach significantly enhanced traceability of calculations by providing a fully documented and version-controlled computational environment, allowing precise tracking of software versions, dependencies, and configuration parameters. I also organized and conducted training sessions on collaborative Git usage, helping the team improve their version control practices, collaborative coding techniques, and software development workflows. The solution streamlined the deployment of complex nuclear simulation tools, enhanced collaboration, and provided a reliable infrastructure for running advanced reactor design calculations."

recommendation_text: "I had the pleasure of working with Baptiste for over a year as he was a consultant for our computation codes team, working in the field of neutronics for molten salt reactors.

His work with us was twofold. First, he was tasked to teach a group of well meaning physicists with limited CS background the ins and outs of good software development practices. This included git workflow, CI/CD setup using GitLab, writing meaningful unit tests, and more. He proved to be a great teacher who could not only teach best practices but also explain why they are best, and when breaking them is justified. When dealing with problems he had not considered before he always displayed great intuition that more often than not proved right.

The second part of his work for us was developing internal tools for our teams, and contributing additional features to open source neutronics code OpenMC. His worked demonstrated the same rigor as his teachings: his well tested and well documented codes are easy to maintain and work with even after his departure. His contribution were made in both python and C++, and I can vouch for his skills in both languages.

Finally Baptiste is a very cheerful person with whom it is easy to get along, with great knowledge and culture on many topics ranging from particle physics to woodworking. During his time with us, the whole team was always glad to see him during his two days of on-site presence per month which we all impatiently awaited."
