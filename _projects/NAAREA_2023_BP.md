title: "Scientific Computing Software Development Support"
description: "I supported NAAREA's advanced nuclear reactor development through a best practices mission focused on improving their computational  modeling and simulation workflows. My work involved comprehensive code review, optimization of nuclear physics simulation tools, and implementation of robust software engineering practices. I advised the team on implementing a standardized Docker-based calculation environment, guiding the development of a reproducible and portable computational workflow that ensures consistent simulation setups across different computing platforms. This containerized approach significantly enhanced traceability of calculations by providing a fully documented and version-controlled computational environment, allowing precise tracking of software versions, dependencies, and configuration parameters. I also organized and conducted training sessions on collaborative Git usage, helping the team improve their version control practices, collaborative coding techniques, and software development workflows. The solution streamlined the deployment of complex nuclear simulation tools, enhanced collaboration, and provided a reliable infrastructure for running advanced reactor design calculations."
