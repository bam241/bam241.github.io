title: "Scientific Computing Software Development Support"
description: "Building upon the initial software development best practices mission with NAAREA's computational team, I expanded the scope of support to their Thermo-hydraulic modeling group. Leveraging the successful Docker-based computational environment and Git workflow established in the previous engagement, I helped the Thermo-hydraulic team adopt similar robust software engineering practices. This extension involved adapting the standardized computational infrastructure to their specific simulation needs, implementing version control strategies, and providing targeted training to improve their software development and collaboration methodologies. By applying the same principles of reproducibility, traceability, and consistent workflow management, I supported the team in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of their complex thermal-hydraulic simulation tools."
