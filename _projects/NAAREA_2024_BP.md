title: "Scientific Computing Software Development Support"
description: "Building upon the initial software development best practices mission with NAAREA's computational team, I expanded the scope of support to their Thermo-hydraulic modeling group. Leveraging the successful controlled computational environment and Git workflow established in the previous engagement, I helped the Thermo-hydraulic team adopt similar robust software engineering practices. This extension involved adapting the standardized computational infrastructure to their specific simulation needs, implementing version control strategies, and providing targeted training to improve their software development and collaboration methodologies. By applying the same principles of reproducibility, traceability, and consistent workflow management, I supported the team in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of their complex thermal-hydraulic simulation tools."
short_description: "I extended my software development support at NAAREA to their Thermo-hydraulic modeling group, helping them adopt the same controlled computational environment and Git workflow previously implemented with the computational team. This ensured consistent, reproducible simulations and improved collaboration for their complex thermal-hydraulic tools."

recommendation_text: "I recently attended a Git training session led by Baptiste and found it to be highly effective and engaging. The interactive format made it easy to grasp fundamental concepts (basic commands and branch management) and more advanced topics like conflict resolution. The hands-on exercises were valuable, allowing me to apply what I learned immediately."
