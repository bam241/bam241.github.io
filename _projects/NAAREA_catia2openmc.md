title: "CATIA to OpenMC"
description: "I developed a software interface between Catia and OpenMC for NAAREA, enabling automated generation of nuclear simulation datasets from complex CAD geometries. The project involved creating a robust Python-based tool that can transform arbitrary mesh geometries into OpenMC-compatible nuclear simulation inputs, supporting various mesh types including tetrahedral and prismatic elements. The interface I designed allows seamless translation of geometric and material information, handling intricate details such as material compositions, temperature distributions, and boundary conditions. Crucially, the software was architected with a modular and extensible design, allowing for easy upgrades and future modifications. This approach ensures that the tool can be readily adapted to evolving simulation requirements and new geometric configurations. By developing a flexible data processing algorithm, the tool can generate precise neutron transport simulation inputs directly from Catia-produced meshes. A key achievement was implementing a comprehensive testing framework with four sophisticated test cases that validate the interface's capability to handle different geometric configurations and material compositions. The solution includes automated error logging, result generation scripts, and the ability to track neutronics simulation convergence indicators. The development prioritized software engineering best practices, ensuring portability across Windows and Linux platforms, minimal dependency on non-standard libraries, and full version control."
