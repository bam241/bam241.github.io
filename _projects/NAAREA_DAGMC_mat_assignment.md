title: "DAGMC assignment"
description: "Enhanced OpenMC's DAGMC geometry support by implementing advanced material override capabilities. This work introduces more flexible material assignment methods for CAD-based geometries, including the ability to replace and override material assignments at the cell level. Critically, the implementation now allows differentiation of materials in DAGMC geometries imported multiple times in the same simulation"

recommendation_text: "Baptiste has been a great partner for the past 3 years (one of the very first at NAAREA's !) :

- able to teach wisely & pedagogically to junior as well as senior developpers,

- expertly dealing with multiple issues brought to him through many intercourses, concerning both code & physics advanced skills throughout a 'support' contract he had cut with NAAREA's Nuke Department,

- combining both self-reliance & reporting at a good level of details when working on a more massive project


Baptiste's communication & interpersonal skills are a great strength for his future partners, he will give you a sincere and honest feedback of
how it was, how it is, how it should be & how it could be, regarding your obligations & constraints.

Flexible he is, putting your satisfaction on top priority !

See you soon Baptiste, & may you cut other deals that will satisfy you intellectually as much as you deserve it !"
