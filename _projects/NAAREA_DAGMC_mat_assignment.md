title: "DAGMC assignment"
description: "Enhanced OpenMC's DAGMC geometry support by implementing advanced material override capabilities. This work introduces more flexible material assignment methods for CAD-based geometries, including the ability to replace and override material assignments at the cell level. Critically, the implementation now allows differentiation of materials in DAGMC geometries imported multiple times in the same simulation"
