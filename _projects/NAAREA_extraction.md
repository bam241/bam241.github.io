recommendation_text: "Baptiste has been working for our company since 2 years now as an external consultant on scientific computations. He was very helpful to carry out some early complicated developments and to help mentoring our junior engineers. The commercial relationship was very straightforward and quality was always there. I would recommend Baptiste in any case you need someone well-versed into neutronics calculations and clean code !"
