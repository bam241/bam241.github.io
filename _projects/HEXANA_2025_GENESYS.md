title: "GENESYS 2.0"

description: "I rewrote a Python module for modular nuclear reactor geometry generation for Hexana, which develops small modular fast neutron reactors (Gen IV) aimed at delivering high‑temperature heat and ultra‑low‑carbon electricity. Hexana’s technology is a Gen IV small modular fast reactor, with a design based on CEA’s heritage (Phénix, Superphénix, ASTRID). I designed the core to be fully tool‑agnostic, with an optional export layer that emits OpenMC‑compliant geometry. Strong typing, schema validation, and explicit data models ensure physical and logical consistency across components. Clear extension points allow new backends or geometry primitives to be added without touching core logic. The redesign includes a full automated test suite with 100% unit test coverage, including edge cases and property‑based scenarios. Targeted refactoring improved performance, clarity, and maintainability. The result is a robust, reproducible geometry pipeline ready for production and CI/CD, supporting Hexana’s flexible and safety‑optimized reactor design workflows."

short_description: "I rewrote Hexana’s modular reactor geometry module for its Gen IV small modular fast reactor, rooted in CEA heritage, with a clean, fully tool-agnostic core and optional OpenMC export. Backed by strong typing, schema-validated models, extensible interfaces, and a 100% coverage test suite, the pipeline is performant, maintainable, and CI/CD-ready to support flexible, safety-optimized design."
