title: "Investment technical review"

description: "I delivered an independent technical review of an SMR startup to guide early-stage investment decisions. The engagement covered a structured assessment of the reactor concept, technology readiness, and design maturity; verification of key claims against benchmarks and open literature; and a comparative analysis against peer SMR developers to contextualize performance, schedule, and risk. I complemented the desk review with interviews of the board’s technical reference person and consultations with relevant subject-matter experts."
