# Basic Info
name: Baptiste Mouginot
title: Freelance Scientific Developer / Nuclear Physics Expert
description: |
  I am a dedicated scientific researcher and consultant with a strong focus on nuclear physics and engineering. At BaM
  Scientific Consulting, I have successfully managed and contributed to projects involving the development of interfaces
  and analytical tools using Python and C++ for clients such as NAAREA and First Light Fusion. My expertise includes Monte
  Carlo simulations and the implementation of best practices in scientific development and analysis.

  As a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I developed tools for stochastic uncertainty propagation and
  enrichment cascade simulations, contributing to significant studies in nuclear non-proliferation. My role involved
  community management, user support, and integrating neural network models within simulation environments.

  I am proficient in a range of technical skills, including Python, C++, OpenMC, and software development tools such as
  Git, Docker, and Pandas. My work emphasizes continuous integration and the application of algorithms to address complex
  scientific problems, ensuring adherence to best practices in scientific development.

    strategies to incorporate best practices in software development, including
    comprehensive testing (unit, regression), continuous integration, and
    effective distribution methods to ensure long-term maintainability.

  - **Training on Best Practices:** I offer training sessions to help teams
    adopt and implement best practices in software development and scientific
    analysis, ensuring that your team is equipped with the skills needed for
    sustainable project success.

  - **Software and Workflow Development:** My services include bug fixing, code
    optimization, test implementation, and setting up virtual environments to
    streamline your software and workflows.

  - **Analysis Tool Development:** I develop custom tools to facilitate data
    analysis and enhance the efficiency of your engineering processes.

  - **Simulation and Analysis Support:** From setting up experimental layouts
    and building input files to executing batch runs and conducting detailed
    analyses, I provide end-to-end support for your simulation needs.

  Let's connect if you'd like to explore ways to leverage my expertise. I'm 
  flexible and can adapt to collaboration formats that best serve your requirements.
